**Project 1: 3D Data Acquisition using a Structured Light Technique**

* Developed system that calculates the 3D coordinates of points in an image lit by a shadow plane, by using structured light techniques.
* Implemented all necessary stages in the process, including the camera calibration process, the light projection system calibration, the edge and line detection algorithms and the final calculation of 3D coordinates.
* Languages/technologies used: Python.

**Grade**: 19 / 20

**Project 2: Artwork Recognition using Bag of Words and CNNs**

* Developed a system that can perform classification of images, applied in this case to the artwork collection dataset provided by the [Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York](https://www.kaggle.com/metmuseum/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-open-access).
* Implemented several methods and techniques to solve the problem, like using a Bag of Words descriptor + classifier, and using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Evaluated the performance of each method using relevant metrics, and discussed the results.

**Grade**: 17.7 / 20
